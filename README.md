# TaskManager
This is a Task Manager web app I built using Spring Boot (Java) for the backend and Angular for the frontend. Itâ€™s a simple app where you can create tasks, view a list of tasks, and check details of a task.  The backend handles APIs and database operations, while the frontend gives a clean UI to interact with tasks.
